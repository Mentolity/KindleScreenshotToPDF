# KindleScreenshotToPDF
Short program I wrote to run through a Kindle book and convert it into a PDF of screenshots.

Simple select the bounds of the of the screenshot and where the next button is and wait for the program to finish running.
The number of pages is currently hardcoded, to what I needed, but it wouldn't be to difficult to change this to user input.
